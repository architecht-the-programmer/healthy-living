      <h4 class="center orange-text deep-orange-text accent-3">What are the benefits of doing squats?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h5><span class="num-style">1.</span> Strengthens your core</h5>
        </li>
        <p>Having strong core muscles can make everyday movements like turning, bending, and even standing easier. Not
          only that, but a strong core can improve your balance, ease pain in your low back, and also make it easier to
          maintain good posture.</p>
        <li>
          <h5><span class="num-style">2.</span> Crushes calories</h5>
        </li>
        <p>Calorie burning is often equated with aerobic exercises such as running or cycling. But performing
          high-intensity, compound movements like the squat can also crush some serious calories.</p>
        <li>
          <h5><span class="num-style">3.</span> Strengthens the muscles of your lower body</h5>
        </li>
        <p>Strength training exercises like squats can help strengthen and tone the muscles in your lower body. When
          these muscles are in good condition, you may find that you can move more comfortably, with less pain, and that
          everything from walking to bending to exercising is easier to do.</p>
        <li>
          <h5><span class="num-style">4.</span> Boosts athletic ability and strength</h5>
        </li>
        <p>If you compete in a sport, adding jump squats to your workout may help you develop explosive strength and
          speed which, in turn, may help improve your athletic performance.</p>
      </ul>

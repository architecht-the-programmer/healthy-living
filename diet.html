                <p>Good health is impossible without good nutrition and good nutrition is only possible through a
                    balanced diet.A healthful diet must be one that is complete,sufficient and balanced.This means one
                    must include at least one food from each of the three main food groups in each meal and vary what
                    they eat.So what are the 3 main food groups??</p>

                <h5 class="center">The 3 main food groups</h5>
                <p class="container">
                    <li class="container">The first group is the <b>carbohydrate group</b> which supplies quick
                        energy.This group includes cereals such as corn,wheat,rice,oats,rye,barley and millet.Tubers
                        such as yams and potatoes also fall under this group.</li>
                    <li class="container">The second group are foods that are a source of <b>protein</b>,iron,zinc and
                        several vitamins.These foods include legumes such as beans,soyabeans,lentils,chickpeas and some
                        foods of animal origin such as meat,fish,eggs and milk with its derivatives.</li>
                    <li class="container">The third group provides essential <b>vitamins and minerals</b> as well as
                        fiber and energy and they represent the only natural source of vitamin C.Fruits and vegetables
                        fall under this group.</li>

                milk.<br>-Thereafter,you can spread your mashed avocado on your toasted bread and add the eggs

                <li>
                    <p><span class="num-style">1.</span> Pick ripe avocados. It all comes down to the avocados. Try to
                        find an avocado that’s ripe, but not over-ripe. You’ll know it’s ripe if you gently squeeze the
                        avocado with the palm of your hands and it yields a little. Don’t use your fingertips because
                        that might bruise it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="num-style">2.</span> Use thick-sliced bread and toast it. It’s best to buy good
                        bread that’s strong enough to hold the avocado and eggs and other toppings you might like to
                        add. Use something that offers a sturdy base like a thick multi-grain bread.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><span class="num-style">3.</span> Mash the avocado with add-ins for more flavor. You can add
                        lemon or lime juice with salt and pepper. You can also add fresh herbs like cilantro, parsley or
                        basil and spices like crushed red pepper, cumin or paprika. It’s almost like a very simple
                        guacamole ready to be spread on toast.</p>

                    bacteria growth and digestive health. It has been shown to regulate blood sugar levels, lower
                    cholesterol, and slow the transit of food through the digestive tract.</p>

                    cell damage caused by oxidants. Freshly squeezed juices are a great way to consume these.</p>

                <p class="black-text">Herbal tea is 'THE' drink if you wish to detoxify your body. Given the amount of
                    toxines contained in the food we eat nowadays, we need to detoxify our body on a regular basis to
                    enjoy a healthy life.</p>
                <p class="black-text">No matter how slim a person is, they would always want to lose more weight. Herbal
                    tea is rich in functional ingredients like physillium husk, fennel and lemongrass which help you to
                    burn fats and also helps in boosting metabolism.</p>

                    damage from the sun. How water improves skin is controversial, but one thing is certain. If your
                    skin loses moisture, it becomes dry and prone to wrinkles.</p>
                <p class="black-text">Research has shown that polyphenol antioxidants found in lemons significantly
                    reduces weight gain. Although some researchers have contradicted, lemon water has been recommended
                    by many.</p>
